# Intelligent Data & Text Analytics – UK Census Data Project

This project analyses the 2011 UK Census dataset using multiple data analytics techniques as part of the "Intelligent Data and Text Analytics" module.

## Objectives
- Perform data exploration on demographic variables
- Apply supervised (classification, regression) and unsupervised (clustering) learning
- Use association rule mining to uncover hidden patterns

## Key Techniques
- **Classification**: Naïve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression
- **Regression**: Linear Regression, Regression Tree
- **Association Rules**: Market-basket style support, confidence, lift
- **Clustering**: K-Means and Hierarchical clustering

## Files Included
- `Sentiment Analysis on IMDB reviews - ratings.pdf` – full report

## Highlights
- **KNN** showed reliable classification for social grade prediction
- **Regression Tree** outperformed linear regression in predicting hours worked
- **Hierarchical clustering** offered deeper, nuanced patterns in socio-economic groups
- Generated rules revealed insight into marriage, employment, and religion correlations

## Tools
Python · Scikit-learn · Seaborn · Matplotlib · pandas · Association rule mining · Clustering techniques
